{"name":"Red Mountain Makers LED Bricks","tagline":"Control LED Bricks above the Red Mountain MakerSpace","body":"### LED Bricks!\r\nThis page can serve as a simple project page for the LED bricks that is a bit easier to digest and accessible by all.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis section could be dedicated to public functionality. I think we all agree it would be awesome for the public to be able to interface with the lights in a secure way. Discussions revolved for a moment around NFC but capacitive touch was suggested which we all agree works best. No phone required and relatively inexpensive. This section could be a FAQ or Help file for anyone trying to use it?\r\n\r\n### Why do you have blinking lights above your building / What's with the lights on 1st North?\r\n\r\nThis will need to be refined but something along the lines of \"We are the Red Mountain Makers and we enjoy making weird stuff.\" Good thing this is a collaborative project cause that's all I've got haha...\r\n\r\n### What can the lights do? Do they just randomly blink?\r\n\r\nNope! They are fully programmed and are doing exactly what we tell them to do! Some functionality includes:\r\n\r\nSolid Colors, Color Chases, Gradients, Pong?, Game of Life? etc.\r\n\r\n### Do you guys do private commissions?\r\n\r\nYes! Depending on the situation we would be happy to discuss your needs. Please keep in mind we are a non-profit hacker space and not a business. If you have a cool project brewing by all means let us know!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nWe are lucky to have a large list of contributors. Maybe best to just say Red Mountain Makers?\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nHaving trouble with the lights? Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/redmountainmakers/led_brick/blob/master/README.md\">documentation</a> or contact us directly and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
