<p>This page can serve as a simple project page for the LED bricks that is a bit easier to digest and accessible by all.</p>

<p>This section could be dedicated to public functionality. I think we all agree it would be awesome for the public to be able to interface with the lights in a secure way. Discussions revolved for a moment around NFC but capacitive touch was suggested which we all agree works best. No phone required and relatively inexpensive. This section could be a FAQ or Help file for anyone trying to use it?</p>

<p>This will need to be refined but something along the lines of "We are the Red Mountain Makers and we enjoy making weird stuff." Good thing this is a collaborative project cause that's all I've got haha...</p>

<p>Nope! They are fully programmed and are doing exactly what we tell them to do! Some functionality includes:</p>

<p>Solid Colors, Color Chases, Gradients, Pong?, Game of Life? etc.</p>

<p>Maybe! Depending on the situation we would be happy to discuss your needs. Please keep in mind we are a non-profit hacker space and not a business. If you have a cool project brewing by all means let us know!</p>
